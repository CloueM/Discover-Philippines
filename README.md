# Discover Philippines

Your simple guide to the Philippines. Explore beautiful destinations, tasty food, and learn about the rich culture and history.

## Purpose

The main goal of this website is to practice Web Design and apply HTML and CSS skills. What I really liked about this project was the freedom to design it the way I wanted.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML & CSS**: The core of this project build. Everything is hardcoded to practice HTML structure and CSS styling.
- **JavaScript**: I took a small step forward to learn Javascript. I used it to make the main image (hero section) slide change every 10 seconds automatically.

## The Process & Challenges

1. **Design**: The project started with a simple Lo-Fi wireframe and eventually turned into a detailed Hi-Fi design. You can view the design on Figma here:

2. **Hardcoding Pages**: The real challenge for me was creating multiple HTML files by hand. I had to manually organize where everything belonged and put them into categories.

3. **File Paths**: Because everything was hardcoded across many folders, keeping track of file paths (making sure links and images loaded correctly) was confusing sometimes.
